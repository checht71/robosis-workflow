- Due to the overwhelming majority of femur fractures being intertrochanteric, the workflow should be biased towards this approach with optional modifications in the workflow towards other fracture types.

- Interestingly, there is no "correct" way to perform a surgery. Different doctors prefer different techniques.

- All sources for intertrochanteric fracture operations use proximal nailing from what I've seen.
