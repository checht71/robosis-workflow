## [Arthrex Trochanteric Nail System](https://cdn.arthrex.io/image/upload/83a422ee-3da1-44cb-b773-5bd233699d00.pdf)
This video is essentially an ad for this system. Dont forget it.
- Uses telescopic lag screw
- ES nail chosen. The ES nail is specific to this system.

### Prep:
Positioning:
- Uninured leg is flexed and abducted in a stirrup
- Injured leg has traction (Distal footholder and perrenial post)

### Main Femoral Nail:

##### Incision:
- 1-3 cm skin incision proximal to greater trochanter
- insert 3.2mm guide pin into tip of greater trochanter
- check AP image to ensure correct alignment (tip of GT from above, mid of GT from side)

##### Reaming:
- ES trochanteric and long trochanteric may require reaming.
- Ream over guide pin with entry reamer. 
- Not necessary to use flexible reamers.

##### Guide wire:
- insert guide wire with gripper into the femur. 
- Advance it until its centered into the distal fragment and use xray to confirm its in the femur.

##### Reaming:
- Ream the entire femur in half dilated increments. 1-1.5mm larger than the nail to be used. 
- Never insert a nail that is bigger than the last reamer diamerter used.
- Slide a guide wire depth gauge over the guide wire. Read the length.

##### Nailing:
- Attach radioluscent targeting arm to nail
- Slip the nail over the guidewire into the incision.
- Softly hit the impactor pad with the hammer if the nail does not enter femur easily

### Lag screw:
- insert lag screw using targeting arm into femur's lateral cortex
- Screw in 3.2mm guide pin
- Check AP and lateral views
	- Centered AP in femoral head slightly inferior 5mm from chonderal bone
- Check depth gauge. Adjust drill to 5mm less than measured depth
- Use 10.3mm cannulated lag screw drill over guide pin. Drill to the stop (5mm less thna measured depth)
- Assemble lag screw on inserter
- Screw into place over guide wire
- Rotate compression sleve until compression is achieved
- Turn black locking T handle until it clicks
- Unscrew the interster, then unscrew the capture rod

##### Post operative compression:
- Remove activation sleeve from lag screw
- Insert activation tool to unscrew the sleeve

### Distal Locking:
- Used for ES and short nail.
- Use the targeting modulef
