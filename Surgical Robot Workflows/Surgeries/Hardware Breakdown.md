How much does the companies technology matter? We should ideally generalize so that robosis can fit as many of these workflows as possible.

## Product Types:
### Proximal Handles:
There are the most bulky pieces of equipment used. These might get in the way of the robosis machine.

### Lag Screws:

### Anti-Rotation Screws

### Short Nails

### Long Nails

### "ES" Nails
These nails are offered specifically by Arthrex. They are long nails which have locking screws similar to a long nail. To my untrained eyes it seems like a lazy way of doing a long nail. They say it "doubles the torsional rigidity" of the nail. They showcase it in their [Troncanteric Nail System Live Surgical Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgNDmvEz9-8). ==But what are are Pt outcomes?==

> "Patients with shaft fractures should not be treated with the ES trochanteric nail."

Todo: Look into scientific literature on the ES nail as well as pricing & outcomes for the Arthrex system.
