Closed attempt, then open if unsucessful.

A reduction is setting the bone into place. A closed reduction is preferable and should be attempted first. A closed reduction is when gentle manipulations are used to set the bone in place without piercing the skin. If that doesn't work, an open reduction may be performed. Open reductions are more invasive and require opening the skin to move the bones into place.
